# React Password Manager
Same idea of an application as the CLI [pwmanager](https://github.com/gmlesher/pwmanager), but with a nice web app interface. Project was initially intended to remain similar to pwmanager, but got large enough to take it to its own repo. 

## Purposes
I only want to remember one password!

React Password Manager was built out of a personal need and interest to have one password in order to access all my online account information

The purposes for building the project this way were as follows:
1. Learning about postgres databases
2. Learning about how hashing works with the [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/) library
3. Learning how encryption works with the [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library
4. Learning how to append, replace, and delete JSON data with python
5. Learn secure ways to generate high quality passwords for users

## Future
In the future, I would like to give this application more functionality. 

Here are some ideas:
- Add option to enable two-factor authorization to log in
- Allow mulitple users to create their own vault and give permission to share vault info with other trusted users
- Restructue code into class based functions for reusability where applicable
